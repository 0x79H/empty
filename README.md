# empty
this program(?) is a enpty program

what can i do by this?
	if you don't want to run some other program, like :teniodl.exe、TQMCenter.exe.
	you can have a new key -->'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\xxx.exe'
	and have a new string value 'Debugger':'empty.exe'
